# Twitch Tetris Redux

This is my version of Twitch Tetris. I originally created it because the original website had been blocked by my middle school's wifi however many years ago that was, haha. I've made some graphical changes, reimplemented custom controls, and added an infinite mode.

There are a lot of issues with this, namely that I just copied the code from the website instead of seeking the source; nearly all of this is obfuscated. However, it has worked for these past 5 years, so I'm not touching it. Feel free to do whatever to this repository--I got permission from Leigh Pauls to do whatever to his source code. I mean, it's open source after all.
